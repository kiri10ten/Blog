This is not a clickbait

but I think this whole world works under timing and luck

I love the vue js community, I never thought I will be using Vue Full Fledgly for a project

my focus was only on machine learning for the past 1 year.

but I was in touch with web development, thanks to my cousin who was learning it, I would spend some time teaching him, so I was able to be still in touch

but these days are a point in my life where I wanted to get a job, so I applied for every job that interested me, UI/UX, Machine learning, and Web Development, thankfully my cousin brought to my attention the company in my district, so I applied for a developer job and I failed in the interview, the blame is on me of course

It made me realize that I should go back and start doing competitive programming and brush up on my problem-solving skill

Then one fine day, thanks to the person I connected with on LinkedIn, she sent me a Google form where there were several job openings, there were several roles mentioned, I wanted to either become a developer or UI/UX designer, thankfully I got selected for the initial round

but miserably failed the same

I am only grateful for the interview, I would have not probably learned all those designs if not for that interview

this time figma become easier and I learned every design concept, Thanks to it, I was able to design for an open-source project too

Later I created a good design for the current project I am talking about, it was a Japanese community project, and I was very thankful when my design was said good!

So I decided to use Vue

While I was brushing up on vue ..here

I came to know so many people were using nuxt, I am not new to static site development, I have used Hexo before, so I had a vague idea

but I wanted to learn how to connect Vue and Django so I searched youtube to find a tutorial fortunately came across this tutorial where code stein created a job board application

I have seen his vue video on freecodecamp before, I like his way of teaching, so I was curious and watched this video

he used nuxt and tailwind CSS

was very glad I watched it

It made me realize really how powerful nuxt was, the next thing I did was to install nuxt and use it

for tailwind css of course it made me understand how powerful and wonderful it is

but It took me another video and I sold myself to tailwind css completely after this, I guess there is no going back once you get used to tailwind css

And I came across a post by Yihong san on Twitter about something on Postresql...one thing led to another and I came across supabase

I don't have to use Django for this project, since supabase provides a database as a service

well, so sorry maybe Vercel is a clickbait, what is there, I know Netlify ...but this time I decided to deploy it on vercel

will create more clear posts on the project, Once I complete it! Thanks for reading ðŸ˜Š
