I don't know ,How I ended up writing this blog post in the midnight with taylor swift's midnight in the background ?!!!


but I hope you find this blog helpful !

I don't want to talk too much ,Let's keep it practical ,the extra details ,you will learn it on your own

Like what is Astro ,why astro and everything ,Here is the link to the official website

https://astro.build/

In the website , I browsed themes under Resources,Inside filter I  selected category ,under category selected portfolio 

As you can see,I selected a very simple yet powerful theme called astrofy 

A template for my Personal Portfolio Website built with Astro and TailwindCSS. Created in minute a website with Blog, CV, Project Section, Store and RSS Feed.

https://astro.build/themes/details/astrofy/

I choose Astrofy for several reason but the main reason would be for markdown editing ,it makes life easy 

I would suggest you to read the github readme provided by the creator of the theme 

He/she may provide extra details on how to further customize the theme 

I read the readme well and changed It acording to my preference ,Initially I  only changed the index.astro and this blog post

Then  I gradually changed few more things to experiment 

> unsolicited advice from sister
>> # Try out ,Trying is free so try 

https://github.com/manuelernestog/astrofy

These are very self explanatory !

you use the command 

```
npm install

```
to install necessary dependency 

Run the command 

```
npm run start

```

Now All left is to build and deploy,use the command 

Actually this was a very painful process for me to understand 

So I just forked the github repo ,made changes ,pushed the repo and connected this repo to netlify 

as simple as it sound it took me lot of time to figure it out

That's how I created my blog website
